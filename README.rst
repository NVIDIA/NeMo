Introduction
------------

NVIDIA NeMo Framework is a scalable and cloud-native generative AI framework built for researchers and PyTorch developers working on Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Models (MMs), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text to Speech (TTS), and Computer Vision (CV) domains. It is designed to help you efficiently create, customize, and deploy new generative AI models by leveraging existing code and pre-trained model checkpoints.

For technical documentation, please see the `NeMo Framework User Guide <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html>`_.

LLMs and MMs Training, Alignment, and Customization
###################################################

All NeMo models are trained with `Lightning <https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning>`_.
Training is automatically scalable to 1000s of GPUs.

When applicable, NeMo models leverage cutting-edge distributed training techniques, incorporating `parallelism strategies <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/modeloverview.html>`_ to enable efficient training of very large models. These techniques include Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and Mixed Precision Training with BFloat16 and FP8, as well as others.

NeMo Transformer-based LLMs and MMs utilize `NVIDIA Transformer Engine <https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine>`_ for FP8 training on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while leveraging `NVIDIA Megatron Core <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core>`_ for scaling Transformer model training.

NeMo LLMs can be aligned with state-of-the-art methods such as SteerLM, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). See `NVIDIA NeMo Aligner <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner>`_ for more information.

In addition to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), NeMo also supports the latest parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA, P-Tuning, Adapters, and IA3. Refer to the `NeMo Framework User Guide <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/sft_peft/index.html>`_ for the full list of supported models and techniques.

Install NeMo Framework
----------------------

The NeMo Framework can be installed in a variety of ways, depending on your needs. Depending on the domain, you may find one of the following installation methods more suitable.

* Conda / Pip - Refer to `Conda <#conda>`_ and `Pip <#pip>`_ for installation instructions.

  * This is the recommended method for ASR and TTS domains.
  * When using a Nvidia PyTorch container as the base, this is the recommended method for all domains.

* Docker Containers - Refer to `Docker containers <#docker-containers>`_ for installation instructions.

  * NeMo Framework container - `nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.05`

* LLMs and MMs Dependencies - Refer to `LLMs and MMs Dependencies <#install-llms-and-mms-dependencies>`_ for installation instructions.

**Important: We strongly recommended that you start with a base NVIDIA PyTorch container: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.02-py3.**

Conda
^^^^^^

Install NeMo in a fresh Conda environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create --name nemo python==3.10.12
    conda activate nemo

Install PyTorch using their `configurator <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia

The command to install PyTorch may depend on your system. Use the configurator linked above to find the right command for your system.

Then, install NeMo via Pip or from Source. We do not provide NeMo on the conda-forge or any other Conda channel.

Pip
^^^

To install the nemo_toolkit, use the following installation method:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
    pip install Cython packaging
    pip install nemo_toolkit['all']

Depending on the shell used, you may need to use the ``"nemo_toolkit[all]"`` specifier instead in the above command.

Pip from a Specific Domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install a specific domain of NeMo, you must first install the nemo_toolkit using the instructions listed above. Then, you run the following domain-specific commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install nemo_toolkit['asr']
    pip install nemo_toolkit['nlp']
    pip install nemo_toolkit['tts']
    pip install nemo_toolkit['vision']
    pip install nemo_toolkit['multimodal']

Pip from a Source Branch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to work with a specific version of NeMo from a particular GitHub branch (e.g main), use the following installation method:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
    pip install Cython packaging
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git@{BRANCH}#egg=nemo_toolkit[all]


Build from Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to clone the NeMo GitHub repository and contribute to NeMo open-source development work, use the following installation method:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
    cd NeMo
    ./reinstall.sh

If you only want the toolkit without the additional Conda-based dependencies, you can replace ``reinstall.sh`` with ``pip install -e .`` when your PWD is the root of the NeMo repository.

Mac Computers with Apple Silicon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install NeMo on Mac computers with the Apple M-Series GPU, you need to create a new Conda environment, install PyTorch 2.0 or higher, and then install the nemo_toolkit.

**Important: This method is only applicable to the ASR domain.**

Run the following code:

.. code-block:: shell

    # [optional] install mecab using Homebrew, to use sacrebleu for NLP collection
    # you can install Homebrew here: https://brew.sh
    brew install mecab

    # [optional] install pynini using Conda, to use text normalization
    conda install -c conda-forge pynini

    # install Cython manually
    pip install cython packaging

    # clone the repo and install in development mode
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
    cd NeMo
    pip install 'nemo_toolkit[all]'

    # Note that only the ASR toolkit is guaranteed to work on MacBook - so for MacBook use pip install 'nemo_toolkit[asr]'

Windows Computers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), run the following code in PowerShell: 

.. code-block:: shell

    wsl --install
    # [note] If you run wsl --install and see the WSL help text, it means WSL is already installed.

To learn more about installing WSL, refer to `Microsoft's official documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_.

After installing your Linux distribution with WSL, two options are available:

**Option 1:** Open the distribution (Ubuntu by default) from the Start menu and follow the instructions.

**Option 2:** Launch the Terminal application. Download it from `Microsoft's Windows Terminal page <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal>`_ if not installed.

Next, follow the instructions for Linux systems, as provided above. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
    cd NeMo
    ./reinstall.sh

RNNT
^^^^

For optimal performance of a Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNNT), install the Numba package from Conda.

Run the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda remove numba
  pip uninstall numba
  conda install -c conda-forge numba

Install LLMs and MMs Dependencies
---------------------------------

If you work with the LLM and MM domains, three additional dependencies are required: NVIDIA Apex, NVIDIA Transformer Engine, and NVIDIA Megatron Core. When working with the `main` branch, these dependencies may require a recent commit.

The most recent working versions of these dependencies are here:

.. code-block:: bash

  export apex_commit=810ffae374a2b9cb4b5c5e28eaeca7d7998fca0c
  export te_commit=bfe21c3d68b0a9951e5716fb520045db53419c5e
  export mcore_commit=fbb375d4b5e88ce52f5f7125053068caff47f93f
  export nv_pytorch_tag=24.02-py3

When using a released version of NeMo, please refer to the `Software Component Versions <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/softwarecomponentversions.html>`_ for the correct versions.

PyTorch Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommended that you start with a base NVIDIA PyTorch container: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.02-py3.

If starting with a base NVIDIA PyTorch container, you must first launch the container:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run \
    --gpus all \
    -it \
    --rm \
    --shm-size=16g \
    --ulimit memlock=-1 \
    --ulimit stack=67108864 \
    nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:$nv_pytorch_tag

Next, you need to install the dependencies.

Apex
^^^^

NVIDIA Apex is required for LLM and MM domains. Although Apex is pre-installed in the NVIDIA PyTorch container, you may need to update it to a newer version.

To install Apex, run the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex.git
    cd apex
    git checkout $apex_commit
    pip install . -v --no-build-isolation --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --config-settings "--build-option=--cpp_ext --cuda_ext --fast_layer_norm --distributed_adam --deprecated_fused_adam --group_norm"

When attempting to install Apex separately from the NVIDIA PyTorch container, you might encounter an error if the CUDA version on your system is different from the one used to compile PyTorch. To bypass this error, you can comment out the relevant line in the setup file located in the Apex repository on GitHub here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex/blob/master/setup.py#L32.

cuda-nvprof is needed to install Apex. The version should match the CUDA version that you are using.

To install cuda-nvprof, run the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install -c nvidia cuda-nvprof=11.8

Finally, install the packaging:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install packaging

To install the most recent versions of Apex locally, it might be necessary to remove the `pyproject.toml` file from the Apex directory.

Transformer Engine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NVIDIA Transformer Engine is required for LLM and MM domains. Although the Transformer Engine is pre-installed in the NVIDIA PyTorch container, you may need to update it to a newer version.

The Transformer Engine facilitates training with FP8 precision on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs and introduces many enhancements for the training of Transformer-based models. Refer to `Transformer Enginer <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/installation.html>`_ for information. 

To install Transformer Engine, run the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine.git && \
  cd TransformerEngine && \
  git checkout $te_commit && \
  git submodule init && git submodule update && \
  NVTE_FRAMEWORK=pytorch NVTE_WITH_USERBUFFERS=1 MPI_HOME=/usr/local/mpi pip install .

Transformer Engine requires PyTorch to be built with at least CUDA 11.8.

Megatron Core
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Megatron Core is required for LLM and MM domains. Megatron Core is a library for scaling large Transformer-based models. NeMo LLMs and MMs leverage Megatron Core for model parallelism, transformer architectures, and optimized PyTorch datasets.

To install Megatron Core, run the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM.git && \
  cd Megatron-LM && \
  git checkout $mcore_commit && \
  pip install . && \
  cd megatron/core/datasets && \
  make

NeMo Text Processing
--------------------

NeMo Text Processing, specifically Inverse Text Normalization, is now a separate repository. It is located here: `https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-text-processing <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-text-processing>`_.

Docker Containers
-----------------

NeMo containers are launched concurrently with NeMo version updates. NeMo Framework now supports LLMs, MMs, ASR, and TTS in a single consolidated Docker container. You can find additional information about released containers on the `NeMo releases page <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/releases>`_.

To use a pre-built container, run the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.05

To build a nemo container with Dockerfile from a branch, run the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

    DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f Dockerfile -t nemo:latest

If you choose to work with the main branch, we recommend using NVIDIA's PyTorch container version 23.10-py3 and then installing from GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v <nemo_github_folder>:/NeMo --shm-size=8g \
    -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit \
    stack=67108864 --device=/dev/snd nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.10-py3
