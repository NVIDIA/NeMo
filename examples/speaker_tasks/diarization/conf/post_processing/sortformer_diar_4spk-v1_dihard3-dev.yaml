# Postprocessing parameters for timestamp outputs from speaker diarization models.
# This speaker diarization postprocessing scheme is inspired by the postprocessing procedure in the following paper:
# Medennikov, Ivan, et al. "Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection: a Novel Approach for Multi-Speaker Diarization in a Dinner Party Scenario." (2020).
# These parameters were optimized with hybrid-loss trained Sortformer model introduced in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06656.
# These parameters were optimized on the development split of DIHARD3 dataset (See https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01477).
# Trial 732 finished with value: 0.12171946949255649 and parameters: {'onset': 0.64, 'offset': 0.74, 'pad_onset': 0.06, 'pad_offset': 0.0, 'min_duration_on': 0.1, 'min_duration_off': 0.15}. Best is trial 732 with value: 0.12171946949255649. 
parameters: 
  onset: 0.64  # Onset threshold for detecting the beginning of a speech segment
  offset: 0.74  # Offset threshold for detecting the end of a speech segment
  pad_onset: 0.06  # Adds the specified duration at the beginning of each speech segment
  pad_offset: 0.0  # Adds the specified duration at the end of each speech segment
  min_duration_on: 0.1  # Removes short silences if the duration is less than the specified minimum duration
  min_duration_off: 0.15  # Removes short speech segments if the duration is less than the specified minimum duration
