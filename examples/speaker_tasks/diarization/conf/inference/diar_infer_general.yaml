# This YAML file is created for all types of offline speaker diarization inference tasks in `<NeMo git root>/example/speaker_tasks/diarization` folder.
# The inference parameters for VAD, speaker embedding extractor, clustering module, MSDD module, ASR decoder are all included in this YAML file. 
# All the keys under `diarizer` key (`vad`, `speaker_embeddings`, `clustering`, `msdd_model`, `asr`) can be selectively used for its own purpose and also can be ignored if the module is not used.
# The configurations in this YAML file is optimized to show balanced performances on various types of domain. VAD is optimized on multilingual ASR datasets and diarizer is optimized on DIHARD3 development set.
