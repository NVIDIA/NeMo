    "## Introduction\n",
    "This Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tutorial is focused on the Jasper model [[2]](#ref2). Jasper is CTC-based [[1]](#ref1) end-to-end model. The model is called “end-to-end” because it transcribes speech samples without any additional alignment information. CTC allows finding an alignment between audio and text. CTC-ASR training pipeline consists of the following blocks:\n",
    "1. audio preprocessing (feature extraction): signal normalization, windowing, (log) spectrogram (or mel scale spectrogram, or MFCC)\n",
    "2. neural acoustic model (which predicts a probability distribution P_t(c) over vocabulary characters c per each time step t given input features per each timestep)\n",
    "3. CTC loss function\n",

Jasper family of models are denoted as Jasper_[BxR] where B is the number of blocks, and R - the number of convolutional sub-blocks within a block.
