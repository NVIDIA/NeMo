# Config to perform ASR adaptation using any pre-trained model (local nemo model or pre-trained checkpoint).
############################################################################################################
# This config is special in that it is used alongside the scripts in the asr_adapters examples directory,
# but does not directly construct a model itself. Instead it mimics the usual ASR model configs, and initializes
# a pre-trained model (either local or via network), and overrides its many data loaders / optimizer / scheduler
# and other arguments
#
# **Note**: This config does *not* get stored in the adapted model, since this config is merely to setup the
# adapter training / inference script. This file can be considered a config not for the model, but for the
# script that will adapt the model or infer an adapted model.
#
# You can therefore call this script multiple times to add as many adapters as you need in a single model,
# by providing the previous adapted checkpoint as `model.nemo_model`.
#
# **Note**: Any config value in this yaml file *overrides* the equivalent config inside the model !
#
# There are some important paramters of this config that must be updated by the user :
# - model.pretrained_model or model.nemo_model: str name or path to some pretrained model. Only one of the
#     two should be passed. Selects the pre-trained model to be loaded and adapted.
#
# - model.adapter.adapter_name: Globally unique name, assigned to the adapter itself. Every adapter of a
#     model must have a unique name.
#
# - model.adapter.in_features: The output dimension of each block of the model. This is model dependent.
#     For example, Conformer dimension can be found via `model.encoder.d_model` in its config.
#     For Citrinets/ContextNets, the dimension can be found usually in `model.encoder.jasper.0.filters`.
#
# - model.train_ds.manifest_filepath / model.validation_ds.manifest_filepath: Data filepaths to train the
#     adapter module.
############################################################################################################
# The recommendations during training of adapters is significantly different than general ASR training or
# fine-tuning. Below are some recommended configuration values.
#
# - model.adapter.dim: Usually we chose a small bottleneck dim here. 16 to 32 is generally enough.
#
# - model.optim.lr: We generally chose a very small LR, and a very short training schedule of just a few hundred
#     steps - depending on the size of the dataset. Usually just a few epochs over the dataset with a low LR is
#     sufficient for adaptation.
#
# - model.optim.weight_decay: We find that strong weight decay prevents significant degradation of prior training,
#     but also limits the capacity of the model to learn the adapted domain. Usually as a baseline we use 0.0
#
# - model.optim.sched.warmup_steps: We encourage warmup steps to be modified to suit the smaller training schedule.
#
# - trainer.max_steps: We recommend using trainer.max_steps to limit the training duration to just 10-20 epochs.
#     Adapters converge very fast, and prolonged training may cause overfitting to the new domain, consequently,
#     leading to catastrophic forgetting of the old domain. You can equivalently use small number of epochs using
#     trainer.max_epochs.
#
# - trainer.check_val_every_n_epoch: Since the training run is short, and very fast usually, it is recommended to
#     reduce the amount of validation to once every few epochs, rather than after every epoch, to speed up training.
