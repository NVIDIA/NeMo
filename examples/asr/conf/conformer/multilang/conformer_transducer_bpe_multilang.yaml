# It contains the default values for training a Conformer-Transducer ASR model, large size (~120M) with Transducer loss and sub-word encoding.
# This config file demonstrates the use of the AggregateTokenizer for multi-lingual model training

# Architecture and training config:
# Default learning parameters in this config are set for effective batch size of 2K. To train it with smaller effective
# batch sizes, you may need to re-tune the learning parameters or use higher accumulate_grad_batches.
# Here are the recommended configs for different variants of Conformer-Transducer, other parameters are the same as in this config file.
