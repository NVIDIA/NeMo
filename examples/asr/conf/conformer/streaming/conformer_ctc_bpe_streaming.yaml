# It contains the default values for training a streaming Conformer-CTC ASR model, large size (~120M) with CTC loss and sub-word encoding.

# Architecture and training config:
# You may find more detail on the architecture and training config at NeMo/examples/asr/comf/offline/conformer_ctc_bpe.yaml

# Models trained with this config have limited right context which make them efficient for streaming ASR
# You may use NeMo/examples/asr/speech_to_text_streaming_infer.py to simulate/evaluate this model in frame-wise streaming mode

# if loss does not go down properly or gives NAN, you may try the followings:
# + using gradient clipping of 1.0
# + increase the warmup steps from 10K to 20K
