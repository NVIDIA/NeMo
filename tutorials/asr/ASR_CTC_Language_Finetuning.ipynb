    "## Japanese Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Even a tiny corpus, with less than 2 hours of speech, comprises nearly 1250 unique tokens! Such large vocabulary is quite common in several languages such as Japanese and Mandarin, which have a vast number of tokens in their vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is interesting to note that not all tokens occur as commonly as others. Take, for example, *Hiragana* and *Katakana* that are widely used in Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Hiragana: 46 base characters\n",
    " - Katakana: 46 base characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Hiragana and Katana also have *diacritics* called [*dakuten*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten_and_handakuten), which change the overall pronunciation of certain hiragana and katakana tokens (and often change the meaning). Including the *dakuten* alongside the base character sets, both hiragana and katakana comprise **71** tokens each.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, a small number of tokens could possibly be used to transcribe a significant chunk of Japanese text read and written. However, even though Hiragana and Katakana share nearly the same number of tokens, hiragana is used far more often. Both combined still account for just 40-45% of all written text. [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system)\n",
    "\n",
    " -------\n",
    "\n",
    "In common vernacular, there are many concepts and words which simply cannot be represented by any set of hiragana and katakana, and in such cases, kanji is used. In reality, while there exists more than 20,000 kanji in circulation, just 2000 of the most common kanji is generally sufficient to represent Japanese text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The widespread use of kanji also means that the \"minimum\" character set for modern Japanese is *at least 2500 tokens*. That is quite a bit larger than the source language - English with its 26 lower case tokens.\n"

The following section will detail how we prepare a CTC model which utilizes a sub-word Encoding scheme.\n",

In Natural Language Processing, we could use enormous vocabulary sizes of 10,000+ tokens, but that is unfeasible for CTC loss training of ASR models.\n",
    "\n",
