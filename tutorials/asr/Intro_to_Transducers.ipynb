        "By following the earlier tutorials for Automatic Speech Recognition in NeMo, one would have probably noticed that we always end up using [Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/) in order to train the model. Speech Recognition can be formulated in many different ways, and CTC is a more popular approach because it is a monotonic loss - an acoustic feature at timestep $t_1$ and $t_2$ will correspond to a target token at timestep $u_1$ and only then $u_2$. This monotonic property significantly simplifies the training of ASR models and speeds up convergence. However, it has certain drawbacks that we will discuss below.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, ASR can be described as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task - the original sequence is an audio sequence (often transformed into mel spectrograms). The target sequence is a sequence of characters (or subword tokens). Attention models are capable of the same sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks. They can even perform better than CTC due to their autoregressive decoding. However, they lack certain inductive biases that can be leveraged to stabilize and speed up training (such as the monotonicity exhibited by the CTC loss). Furthermore, by design, attention models require the entire sequence to be available to align the sequence to the output, thereby preventing their use for streaming inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then comes the [Transducer Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3711). Proposed by Alex Graves, it aimed to resolve the issues in CTC loss while resolving the transcription accuracy issues by performing autoregressive decoding. \n",

        "\n",
        "CTC is an excellent loss to train ASR models in a stable manner but comes with certain limitations on model design. If we presume speech recognition to be a sequence-to-sequence problem, let $T$ be the sequence length of the acoustic model's output, and let $U$ be the sequence length of the target text transcript (post tokenization, either as characters or subwords). \n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "1) CTC imposes the limitation : $T \\ge U$. Normally, this assumption is naturally valid because $T$ is generally a lot longer than the final text transcription. However, there are many cases where this assumption fails.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Acoustic model performs downsampling to such a degree that $T \\ge U$. Why would we want to perform so much downsampling? For convolutions, longer sequences take more stride steps and more memory. For Attention-based models (say Conformer), there's a quadratic memory cost of computing the attention step in proportion to $T$. So more downsampling significantly helps relieve the memory requirements. There are ways to bypass this limitation, as discussed in the `ASR_with_Subword_Tokenization` notebook, but even that has limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The target sequence is generally very long. Think of languages such as German, which have very long translations for short English words. In the task of ASR, if there is more than 2x downsampling and character tokenization is used, the model will often fail to learn due to this CTC limitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Tokens predicted by models which are trained with just CTC loss are assumed to be *conditionally independent*. This means that, unlike language models where *h*-*e*-*l*-*l* as input would probably predict *o* to complete *hello*, for CTC trained models - any character from the English alphabet has equal likelihood for prediction. So CTC trained models often have misspellings or missing tokens when transcribing the audio segment to text. \n",
        "\n",
        "- Since we often use the Word Error Rate (WER) metric when evaluating models, even a single misspelling contributes significantly to the \"word\" being incorrect. \n",
        "\n",
        "- To alleviate this issue, we have to resort to Beam Search via an external language model. While this often works and significantly improves transcription accuracy, it is a slow process and involves large N-gram or Neural language models. "

Generally, T + U_max < T * max_symmetric_expansions. However, ALSD beams are non-unique. Therefore it is required to use larger beam sizes to achieve the same (or close to the same) decoding accuracy as TSD.
