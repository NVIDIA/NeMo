After pre-training our encoder in this way, we can use it in a CTC or RNNT ASR model.\n",

The model is then trained to solve a contrastive task of distinguishing the latent representation of the masked time steps from several sampled distractors.

They are then passed through a quantizer, which has been found to help with contrastive pre-training."
