    "# Introduction to Speaker Diarization\n",
    "Speaker diarization is the task of segmenting audio recordings by speaker labels and answers the question \"Who Speaks When?\". A speaker diarization system consists of Voice Activity Detection (VAD) model to get the timestamps of audio where speech is being spoken ignoring the background and speaker embeddings model to get speaker embeddings on segments that were previously time stamped. These speaker embedding vectors are then grouped into clusters and the number of speakers is estimated by clustering algorithm. Finally, based on the speaker profiles created from clustering results, neural diarizer generates speaker labels including overlap speech. The below figure shows the data-flow of NeMo speaker diarization."

    "### Multi-scale Approach for Segmentation, Speaker Embedding Extraction and Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uniform Segmentation\n",
    "After the input signal goes through VAD module, we extract speaker embeddings from segmented audio then we extract speaker embedding vector from each and every segment. When we segment audio signal into short (0.5~3.0 sec) segments, we get speaker profile (speaker representation) for the specific segment. When it comes to segment length, there is trade-off between the quality of speaker representation and granularity (temporal resolution). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trade-off: Long VS Short Segment Length\n",
    "If we use long segments (e.g. longer than 2-3 seconds), we get fairly consistent and high-quality speaker representations but at the same time, we lose temporal resolution since we need to make a decision on the 2~3 second long segment which can lead to significant errors. On the other hand, if we use very short segments (0.2-0.5 sec), temporal resolution is superior but it is very challenging to extract reliable speaker characteristics from such short speech segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiscale Segmentation\n",
    "In NeMo speaker diarization pipeline, we employ multi-scale approach to deal with such a trade-off between long and short segment lengths. We use multiple scales (segment lengths) and fuse the affinity values from each scale's result. An example of multi-scale segmentation looks like the following figure:"
