    "#### Task Description\n",
    "[Entity linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking) is the process of connecting concepts mentioned in natural language to their canonical forms stored in a knowledge base. For example, say a knowledge base contained the entity 'ID3452 influenza' and we wanted to process some natural language containing the sentence \"The patient has flu like symptoms\". An entity linking model would match the word 'flu' to the knowledge base entity 'ID3452 influenza', allowing for disambiguation and normalization of concepts referenced in text. Entity linking applications range from helping automate data ingestion to assisting in real time dialogue concept normalization. We will be focusing on entity linking in the medical domain for this demo, but the entity linking model, dataset, and training code within NVIDIA NeMo can be applied to other domains like finance and retail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within NeMo and this tutorial we use the entity linking approach described in Liu et. al's NAACL 2021 \"[Self-alignment Pre-training for Biomedical Entity Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11784v2)\". The main idea behind this approach is to reshape an initial concept embedding space such that synonyms of the same concept are pulled closer together and unrelated concepts are pushed further apart. The concept embeddings from this reshaped space can then be used to build a knowledge base embedding index. This index stores concept IDs mapped to their respective concept embeddings in a format conducive to efficient nearest neighbor search. We can link query concepts to their canonical forms in the knowledge base by performing a nearest neighbor search- matching concept query embeddings to the most similar concepts embeddings in the knowledge base index. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be using the [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) library to build our concept index."

    "#### Self Alignment Pretraining\n",
    "Self-Alignment pretraining is a second stage pretraining of an existing encoder (called second stage because the encoder model can be further finetuned after this more general pretraining step). The dataset used during training consists of pairs of concept synonyms that map to the same ID. At each training iteration, we only select *hard* examples present in the mini batch to calculate the loss and update the model weights. In this context, a hard example is an example where a concept is closer to an unrelated concept in the mini batch than it is to the synonym concept it is paired with by some margin. I encourage you to take a look at [section 2 of the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11784.pdf) for a more formal and in depth description of how hard examples are selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use a [metric learning loss](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Wang_Multi-Similarity_Loss_With_General_Pair_Weighting_for_Deep_Metric_Learning_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) calculated from the hard examples selected. This loss helps reshape the embedding space. The concept representation space is rearranged to be more suitable for entity matching via embedding cosine similarity. \n",
