    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a tutorial of data processing and cleaning for NMT (Neural Machine Translation) to train translation models with the [NeMo framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo).\n",
    "\n",
    "A pre-requisite to train supervised neural machine translation systems is the availability of *parallel corpora* of reasonable quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "A parallel corpus is a collection of sentences or documents that are translations of each other in 2 or more languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "| English                                                                            | Russian |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| To date, a total of 43 participants from 15 countries have completed the training. | К настоящему времени подготовку прошли в общей сложности 43 участника из 15 стран . |\n",

    "| Information in the application was not true. | Информация в заявлении не была достоверна. |\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover the following data pre-processing and data cleaning techniques for such corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The importance of data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of noise in the training dataset can adversely affect model quality (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12282). Webcrawled and automatically aligned data sources in particular, such as [Paracrawl](https://paracrawl.eu/), [WikiMatrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05791), [CC-Aligned](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06154) and [CC-Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04944) can be extremely noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning\n",
    "1. Downloading and filtering publicly available datasets based on confidence thresholds (if available). For example, [WikiMatrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05791) filtering based on [LASER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10464) confidence scores.\n",
    "2. Language ID filtering using a pre-trained [fastText classifier](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html). This step will remove all sentences from the parallel corpus that our classifier predicts as not being in the appropriate language (ex: sentences in the English column that aren't in English or sentences in Russian column that aren't in Russian).\n",
    "3. Length and Length-ratio filtering. This steps removes all sentences that are 1) too long 2) too short or 3) have a ratio between their lengths greater than a certain factor (this typically removes partial translations).\n",
    "4. [Bicleaner](https://github.com/bitextor/bicleaner) classifier-based cleaning. Bicleaner identifies noisy parallel sentences using a classifier that leverages multiple features such as n-gram language model likelihood scores, word alignment scores and other heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-processing\n",
    "5. [Moses Punctuation Normalization](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/tokenizer/normalize-punctuation.perl). This step standardizes punctuation. For example the less common way to write apostrophes Tiffany`s will be standardized to Tiffany's.\n",
    "6. Unicode standardization. There exist some unicode characters that aren't punctuation that need to be standardized for example, this step normalizes the number ４ to 4.\n",
    "7. [Moses Tokenization](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/tokenizer/tokenizer.perl) or text segmentation for Chinese/Japanese with [Jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba) and [mecab](https://github.com/taku910/mecab). For languages like Chinese and Japanese that do not have explicit word segmentation markers (like spaces), we use these tools to introduce spaces into the text that will let us split the string into words. For other languages, we use Moses to separate punctuation markers from words so that they become separate tokens.\n",
    "8. Deduplication - This step removes duplicate translation pairs from the corpus.\n",
    "9. Shuffling - This step shuffles the order of occurrence of translation pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tarred Datasets for Large Corpora\n",
    "10. Large datasets with over 50M sentence pairs when batched and pickled can be up to 60GB in size. Loading them entirely into CPU memory when using say 8 or 16 workers with DistributedDataParallel training uses 480-960GB of RAM which is often impractical and inefficient. Instead, we use [Webdataset](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset) to allow training while keeping datasets on disk and let webddataset handle pre-loading and fetching of data into CPU RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "The data cleaning techniques used in this notebook are only meant to be loose guidelines and are not guaranteed to produced clean parallel corpora at the end of it. Not all of these steps are a necessity for every dataset, "
