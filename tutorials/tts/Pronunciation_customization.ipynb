    "## Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern **text-to-speech** (TTS) models can learn pronunciations from raw text input and its corresponding audio data.\n",
    "Sometimes, however, it is desirable to customize pronunciations, for example, for domain-specific terms. As a result, many TTS systems use grapheme and phonetic input during training to directly access and correct pronunciations at inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) and [ARPABET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET) are the most common phonetic alphabets. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to customize pronunciations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pass phonemes as an input to the TTS model, note that the request-time overrides are best suited for one-off adjustments\n",
    "2. configure TTS model with the desired domain-specific terms using custom phonetic dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods require users to convert graphemes into phonemes (G2P). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### All words for G2P purposes could be divided into the following groups:\n",
    "* *known* words - words that are present in the model's phonetic dictionary\n",
    "* *out-of-vocabulary (OOV)* words - words that are missing from the model's phonetic dictionary. \n",
    "* *[heteronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_&#40;linguistics&#41;)* - words with the same spelling but different pronunciations and/or meanings, e.g., *bass* (the fish) and *bass* (the musical instrument).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important NeMo flags:\n",
    "* `your_spec_generator_model.vocab.g2p.phoneme_dict` - phoneme dictionary that maps words to their phonetic transcriptions, e.g., [ARPABET-based CMU Dictionary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/stable/scripts/tts_dataset_files/cmudict-0.7b_nv22.10) or [IPA-based CMU Dictionary](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/stable/scripts/tts_dataset_files/ipa_cmudict-0.7b_nv23.01.txt)\n",
    "* `your_spec_generator_model.vocab.g2p.heteronyms` - list of the model's heteronyms, grapheme form of these words will be used even if the word is present in the phoneme dictionary.\n",
    "* `your_spec_generator_model.vocab.g2p.ignore_ambiguous_words`: if is set to **True**, words with more than one phonetic representation in the pronunciation dictionary are ignored. This flag is relevant to the words with multiple valid phonetic transcriptions in the dictionary that are not in `your_spec_generator_model.vocab.g2p.heteronyms` list.\n",
    "* `your_spec_generator_model.vocab.phoneme_probability` - phoneme probability flag in the Tokenizer and the same from in the G2P module: `your_spec_generator_model.vocab.g2p.phoneme_probability` ([0, 1]). If a word is present in the phoneme dictionary, we still want our TTS model to see graphemes and phonemes during training to handle OOV words during inference. The `phoneme_probability` determines the probability of an unambiguous dictionary word appearing in phonetic form during model training, `(1 - phoneme_probability)` is the probability of the graphemes. This flag is set to `1` in the parse() method during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the desired pronunciation, we need to add a new entry to the model's phonetic dictionary. If the target word is already in the dictionary, we need to remove the default pronunciation so that only the target pronunciation is present. "
