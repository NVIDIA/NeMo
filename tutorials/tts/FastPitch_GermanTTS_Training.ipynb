    "\n",
    "FastPitch is non-autoregressive model for mel-spectrogram generation based on FastSpeech, conditioned on fundamental frequency contours. For more details about model, please refer to the original [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9413889). Original [FastPitch model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9413889) uses an external Tacotron 2 model trained on LJSpeech-1.1 to extract training alignments and estimate durations of input symbols. This implementation of FastPitch is based on [Deep Learning Examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/SpeechSynthesis/FastPitch), which uses an alignment mechanism proposed in [RAD-TTS](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=0NQwnnwAORi) and extended in [TTS Aligner](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9747707).\n",

    "### HiFiGAN\n",
    "HiFiGAN is a generative adversarial network (GAN) model that generates audio from mel spectrograms. The generator uses transposed convolutions to upsample mel spectrograms to audio. For more details about the model, please refer to the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646). NeMo re-implementation of HiFi-GAN can be found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/nemo/collections/tts/models/hifigan.py)."

NeMo provides an efficient script, [scripts/dataset_processing/tts/generate_mels.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvidia/NeMo/main/scripts/dataset_processing/tts/generate_mels.py), to generate Mel-spectrograms in the directory `NeMoGermanTTS/mels` and also create new JSON manifests with a suffix `_mel` by adding a new key `\"mel_filepath\"`. For example, `train_manifest_text_normed.json` corresponds to `train_manifest_text_normed_mel.json` saved in the same directory. You can run the following CLI to obtain the new JSON manifests."
