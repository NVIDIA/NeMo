    "1.   Group together audio samples into a much smaller set of time buckets, called **audio frames**. An audio frame will usually bucket around 50ms of audio.\n",
    "2.   For each audio frame, use the [Fast Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) (**FFT**) to calculate the magnitude (ie. energy, amplitude or \"loudness\") and phase (which we don't use) of each frequency bin. We refer to the magnitudes of the frequency bins as a spectrogram\n",
    "3.   Map the original frequency bins onto the [mel scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale), using overlapped [triangular filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function#Triangular_window) to create mel filterbanks.\n",
    "4.   Multiply the original spectrogram by the mel filterbanks to produce a mel spectrogram (for more details see [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/audio/ref/melspectrogram.html)).\n",

    "The reason for converting from hertz to mel frequency is that hertz are a physical measurement, while mel frequency better captures how humans perceive sound. Human ears are more sensitive to low frequencies than high frequencies. So low frequency bands would have large impact on the perceived sound while high frequency bands might have little to no effect. On the mel scale, the impact of different frequency bands are more evenly distributed."

    "In addition to the mel spectrogram providing handcrafted features that are closer to human perception and easier to predict, there are a few other advantages to using it over audio samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Computational Efficiency**\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason to use a spectrogram is that it is a lot more computationally efficient than processing raw audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example a 10 second piece of audio sampled at 44.1 kHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "This audio has 10 * 44,100 = 441,000 audio samples.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our final spectrogram has 80 bands * 10s * / (0.01s) = 80,000\n",
    "\n",
    "So we made our data about 5 times smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in other fields that deal with audio, such as *digital signal processing (DSP)*, it is common practice to reduce computation time by computing the FFT, running mathematical calculations and manipulations in the frequency domain, and then converting the final spectrogram back to audio with the *inverse* FFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Shorter 2D sequence length**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the dimension of our input goes from being (441,000, 1) to (1000, 80). Instead of having a very long 1-dimensional time series, we instead have a much shorter sequence of multi-dimensional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dimensionality works better with most modern deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most models work better representing large chunks/sequences of information as higher dimension vectors (eg. *embeddings*).\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNN/LSTM** architectures have latency proportional to the length of the sequence, can struggle to remember information for sequences over a few hundred tokens long, and are more prone to vanishing/exploding gradients as the sequence gets longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "With 2 dimensions we can effectively use **CNNs** by running [temporal convolutions](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv1d.html?highlight=conv1d#torch.nn.Conv1d) over the time dimension. Or by applying [2d convolutions](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html?highlight=conv2d#torch.nn.Conv2d) to the spectrogram exactly as if it were an image in computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformers** require computation/memory that is proportional to the length of the sequence squared. This means we can easily use large transformers for relatively short sequences like in NLP, smaller transformers for longer sequences like spectrogram data, and are impractical to use on very long sequences like audio samples."

    "Another very important aspect of TTS modeling is **teacher forcing**, which means that during training we provide various pieces of ground truth information to the model and at inference provide equivalent predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a model to directly predict a spectrogram from text by itself does not work, for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Spectrogram Synthesis is a difficult enough problem that most models will not converge to anything meaningful if its only input is text.\n",

In other words, each decoder step predicts an audio frame. During training, the ground truth audio frame is passed to the next decoder step. During inference, the predicted audio frame is passed to the next decoder step. In Tacotron 2, the pre-net applies a large amount of dropout to this input to avoid overfitting.\n",

    "*   **Pitch**: By providing the pitch, aka. the [fundamental frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency) **(F0)**, for each character, a model is able to better learn and mimic a variety of natural speaking patterns.\n",
    "*   **Speaking Rate**: By providing the length of the ground truth spectrogram as an input feature, the model is able to easily disambiguate how long the final audio should be. At inference time a user can then manually change the input value to make the model speak as slow or as fast as they want.\n",
    "*   **Style Embeddings**: By training an *auto-encoder* on the TTS training data, it is possible to represent very complex speaking styles with utterance-level embeddings. Taking a style embedding from one utterance to make a speaker say a different sentence with the same speaking characteristics is referred to as **style transfer**.\n"
