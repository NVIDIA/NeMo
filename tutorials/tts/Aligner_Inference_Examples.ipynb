    "# TTS Aligner Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through how to perform inference on a **[RAD-TTS Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10447)** checkpoint. This tutorial will cover everything from preprocessing input text and audio to generating token duration predictions and alignments. We will be visualizing and examining these steps as we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also show an example of how you can use the alignments generated by the text/audio embeddings to perform **phoneme disambiguation** of a word with multiple possible pronunciations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires an already-trained Aligner checkpoint and a sample from [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/). Once an NGC checkpoint is released, it will be updated to use that by default. You should also be able to substitute in your own model checkpoint and samples with the code shown, if you wish.\n",
