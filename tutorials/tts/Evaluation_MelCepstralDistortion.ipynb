    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to calculate **mel cepstral distortion (MCD)** with **dynamic time warping (DTW)** between a synthesized mel spec and a reference mel spec. MCD DTW can be useful for comparing models trained on the same training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCD is an objective measure of speech quality that is calculated between pairs of TTS-generated mel spectrograms and ground truth mel spectrograms. Two mel spectrograms are similar if the MCD value between them is low; as you might expect, the MCD of a mel spec with itself is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCD DTW is a modification of MCD that works with non-aligned mels by using a dynamic time warping cost matrix. (Vanilla MCD can only be measured for two mels that are both the same length, and which are assumed to be aligned.) The scale depends on factors such as the mel extractor and reduction algorithm (mean of DTW cost or min DTW path cost)."
