    "As one probably noticed, the audio file contains a prologue and an epilogue that are missing in the corresponding text. The segmentation algorithm could handle extra audio fragments at the end and the beginning of the audio, but prolonged untranscribed audio segments in the middle of the file could deteriorate segmentation results. That's why to improve the segmentation quality, it is recommended to normalize text, so that transcript contains spoken equivalents of abbreviations and numbers.\n",

    "* to change the lengths of the final sentences/fragments, use `min_length` and `max_length` arguments, that specify min/max number of chars of the text segment for alignment.\n",
    "* to specify additional punctuation marks to split the text into fragments, use `--additional_split_symbols` argument. If segments produced after splitting the original text based on the end of sentence punctuation marks is longer than `--max_length`, `--additional_split_symbols` are going to be used to shorten the segments. Use `|` as a separator between symbols, for example: `--additional_split_symbols=;|:`\n",
    "* out-of-vocabulary words will be removed based on pre-trained ASR model vocabulary, (optionally) text will be changed to lowercase \n",
    "* sentences for alignment with the original punctuation and capitalization will be stored under  `$OUTPUT_DIR/processed/*_with_punct.txt`\n",
    "* numbers will be converted from written to their spoken form with `num2words` package. To use NeMo normalization tool use `--use_nemo_normalization` argument (not supported if running this segmentation tutorial in Colab, see the text normalization tutorial: [`tutorials/text_processing/Text_Normalization.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/stable/tutorials/text_processing/Text_Normalization.ipynb) for more details). Such normalization is usually enough for proper segmentation. However, it does not take audio into account. NeMo supports audio-based normalization for English and Russian languages that can be applied to the segmented data as a post-processing step. Audio-based normalization produces multiple normalization options. For example, `901` could be normalized as `nine zero one` or `nine hundred and one`. The audio-based normalization chooses the best match among the possible normalization options and the transcript based on the character error rate. Note, the audio-based normalization of long audio samples is not supported due to many possible normalization options. See [https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/nemo_text_processing/text_normalization/normalize_with_audio.py](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/nemo_text_processing/text_normalization/normalize_with_audio.py) for more details.\n",

    "* audio files will be resampled to use the same sampling rate as was used to pre-train the ASR model we're using for alignment\n",
    "* stereo tracks will be converted to mono\n",
    "* since librivox.org audio contains relatively long prologues, we're also cutting a few seconds from the beginning of the audio files (optional step, see `--cut_prefix` argument). In some cases, if an audio contains a very long untranscribed prologue, increasing `--cut_prefix` value might help improve segmentation quality.\n",
