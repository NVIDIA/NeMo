    "In the application of LLMs, agents represent an exciting field. They are intelligent systems capable of simulating human-like intelligent behavior to perform specific tasks or services. LLM-based agents can leverage the powerful comprehension and generation capabilities of LLMs while also incorporating the planning and function-calling abilities to accomplish many complex tasks.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to learn function-calling (tool learning) using NeMo 2.0. NeMo 2.0 introduces Python-based configurations, PyTorch Lightning’s modular abstractions, and NeMo-Run for scaling experiments across multiple GPUs. In this notebook, we will use NeMo-Run to streamline the configuration and execution of our experiments."
