NeMo LLM Collection
===================

The NeMo LLM Collection introduces NeMo 2.0, a redesign that enhances the user experience by adopting a more PyTorch Lightning-like approach. This redesign aims to simplify NeMo and make it more modular.

The following models are currently reimplemented in 2.0 as part of this collection:
- **GPT**
- **LLaMA**
- **Mixtral**

For detailed tutorials and documentation on NeMo 2.0, refer to the [docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemo_2.0/index.html).
