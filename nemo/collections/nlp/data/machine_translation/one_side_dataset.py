class TarredOneSideTranslationDataset(IterableDataset):
    """
    A similar Dataset to the TranslationDataset, but which loads tarred tokenized pickle files.
    Accepts a single JSON metadata file containing the total number of batches
    as well as the path(s) to the tarball(s) containing the wav files. 
    Valid formats for the text_tar_filepaths argument include:
    (1) a single string that can be brace-expanded, e.g. 'path/to/text.tar' or 'path/to/text_{1..100}.tar.gz', or
    (2) a list of file paths that will not be brace-expanded, e.g. ['text_1.tar', 'text_2.tar', ...].
    Note: For brace expansion in (1), there may be cases where `{x..y}` syntax cannot be used due to shell interference.
    This occurs most commonly inside SLURM scripts. Therefore we provide a few equivalent replacements.
    Supported opening braces - { <=> (, [, < and the special tag _OP_.
    Supported closing braces - } <=> ), ], > and the special tag _CL_.
    For SLURM based tasks, we suggest the use of the special tags for ease of use.
    See the WebDataset documentation for more information about accepted data and input formats.
    If using multiple processes the number of shards should be divisible by the number of workers to ensure an
    even split among workers. If it is not divisible, logging will give a warning but training will proceed.
    Additionally, please note that the len() of this DataLayer is assumed to be the number of tokens
    of the text data. An incorrect manifest length may lead to some DataLoader issues down the line.
    Args:
        text_tar_filepaths: Either a list of tokenized text tarball filepaths, or a
            string (can be brace-expandable).
        metadata_path (str): Path to the metadata manifest.
        encoder_tokenizer: Autokenizer wrapped BPE tokenizer model, such as YTTM
        decoder_tokenizer: Autokenizer wrapped BPE tokenizer model, such as YTTM
        shuffle_n (int): How many samples to look ahead and load to be shuffled.
            See WebDataset documentation for more details.
            Defaults to 0.
        shard_strategy (str): Tarred dataset shard distribution strategy chosen as a str value during ddp.
            -   `scatter`: The default shard strategy applied by WebDataset, where each node gets
                a unique set of shards, which are permanently pre-allocated and never changed at runtime.
            -   `replicate`: Optional shard strategy, where each node gets all of the set of shards
                available in the tarred dataset, which are permanently pre-allocated and never changed at runtime.
                The benefit of replication is that it allows each node to sample data points from the entire
                dataset independently of other nodes, and reduces dependence on value of `shuffle_n`.
                Note: Replicated strategy allows every node to sample the entire set of available tarfiles,
                and therefore more than one node may sample the same tarfile, and even sample the same
                data points! As such, there is no assured guarantee that all samples in the dataset will be
                sampled at least once during 1 epoch.
        global_rank (int): Worker rank, used for partitioning shards. Defaults to 0.
        world_size (int): Total number of processes, used for partitioning shards. Defaults to 0.
        reverse_lang_direction (bool): When True, swaps the source and target directions when returning minibatches.
