        NOTE:
            The implementation of this model is slightly modified from the original paper.
            The original paper proposes the following steps :

            *1 -> Forward through joint final [B, T, U, V + 1].

            We instead split the joint hidden into joint_hidden_enc and joint_hidden_dec and act as follows:
            enc -> Forward through joint_hidden_enc -> Expand [B, T, 1, H] -- *1
            dec -> Forward through joint_hidden_dec -> Expand [B, 1, U, H] -- *2
