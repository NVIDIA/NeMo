class RNNTDecoder(rnnt_abstract.AbstractRNNTDecoder, Exportable):
    """A Recurrent Neural Network Transducer Decoder / Prediction Network (RNN-T Prediction Network).
    An RNN-T Decoder/Prediction network, comprised of a stateful LSTM model.

    Args:
        prednet: A dict-like object which contains the following key-value pairs.
            pred_hidden: int specifying the hidden dimension of the prediction net.
            pred_rnn_layers: int specifying the number of rnn layers.

            Optionally, it may also contain the following:
            forget_gate_bias: float, set by default to 1.0, which constructs a forget gate
                initialized to 1.0.
                Reference:
                [An Empirical Exploration of Recurrent Network Architectures](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/jozefowicz15.pdf)
            t_max: int value, set to None by default. If an int is specified, performs Chrono Initialization
                of the LSTM network, based on the maximum number of timesteps `t_max` expected during the course
                of training.
                Reference:
                [Can recurrent neural networks warp time?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJcKhk-Ab)
            weights_init_scale: Float scale of the weights after initialization. Setting to lower than one
                sometimes helps reduce variance between runs.
            hidden_hidden_bias_scale: Float scale for the hidden-to-hidden bias scale. Set to 0.0 for
                the default behaviour.
            dropout: float, set to 0.0 by default. Optional dropout applied at the end of the final LSTM RNN layer.

        vocab_size: int, specifying the vocabulary size of the embedding layer of the Prediction network,
            excluding the RNNT blank token.

        normalization_mode: Can be either None, 'batch' or 'layer'. By default, is set to None.
            Defines the type of normalization applied to the RNN layer.

        random_state_sampling: bool, set to False by default. When set, provides normal-distribution
            sampled state tensors instead of zero tensors during training.
            Reference:
            [Recognizing long-form speech using streaming end-to-end models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11455)

        blank_as_pad: bool, set to True by default. When set, will add a token to the Embedding layer of this
            prediction network, and will treat this token as a pad token. In essence, the RNNT pad token will
            be treated as a pad token, and the embedding layer will return a zero tensor for this token.

            It is set by default as it enables various batch optimizations required for batched beam search.
            Therefore, it is not recommended to disable this flag.

class RNNTJoint(rnnt_abstract.AbstractRNNTJoint, Exportable):
    """A Recurrent Neural Network Transducer Joint Network (RNN-T Joint Network).
    An RNN-T Joint network, comprised of a feedforward model.

    Args:
        jointnet: A dict-like object which contains the following key-value pairs.
            encoder_hidden: int specifying the hidden dimension of the encoder net.
            pred_hidden: int specifying the hidden dimension of the prediction net.
            joint_hidden: int specifying the hidden dimension of the joint net
            activation: Activation function used in the joint step. Can be one of
                ['relu', 'tanh', 'sigmoid'].

            Optionally, it may also contain the following:
            dropout: float, set to 0.0 by default. Optional dropout applied at the end of the joint net.

        num_classes: int, specifying the vocabulary size that the joint network must predict,
            excluding the RNNT blank token.

        vocabulary: Optional list of strings/tokens that comprise the vocabulary of the joint network.
            Unused and kept only for easy access for character based encoding RNNT models.

        log_softmax: Optional bool, set to None by default. If set as None, will compute the log_softmax()
            based on the value provided.

        preserve_memory: Optional bool, set to False by default. If the model crashes due to the memory
            intensive joint step, one might try this flag to empty the tensor cache in pytorch.

            Warning: This will make the forward-backward pass much slower than normal.
            It also might not fix the OOM if the GPU simply does not have enough memory to compute the joint.

        experimental_fuse_loss_wer: Optional bool, set to False by default.
            NOTE: This is an experimental feature that attempts to trade of compute time for memory preservation.
            There may be undetermined effects to convergence behaviour.

            Fuses the joint forward, loss forward and
            wer forward steps. In doing so, it trades of speed for memory conservation by creating sub-batches
            of the provided batch of inputs, and performs Joint forward, loss forward and wer forward (optional),
            all on sub-batches, then collates results to be exactly equal to results from the entire batch.

            When this flag is set, prior to calling forward, the fields `loss` and `wer` (either one) *must*
            be set using the `RNNTJoint.set_loss()` or `RNNTJoint.set_wer()` methods.

            Further, when this flag is set, the following argument `fused_batch_size` *must* be provided
            as a non negative integer. This value refers to the size of the sub-batch.

            When the flag is set, the input and output signature of `forward()` of this method changes.
            Input - in addition to `encoder_outputs` (mandatory argument), the following arguments can be provided.
                - decoder_outputs (optional). Required if loss computation is required.
                - encoder_lengths (required)
                - transcripts (optional). Required for wer calculation.
                - transcript_lengths (optional). Required for wer calculation.
                - compute_wer (bool, default false). Whether to compute WER or not for the fused batch.

            Output - instead of the usual `joint` log prob tensor, the following results can be returned.
                - loss (optional). Returned if decoder_outputs, transcripts and transript_lengths are not None.
                - wer_numerator + wer_denominator (optional). Returned if transcripts, transcripts_lengths are provided
                    and compute_wer is set.

        fused_batch_size: Optional int, required if `fuse_loss_wer` flag is set. Determines the size of the
            sub-batches. Should be any value below the actual batch size per GPU.

        Compute the joint step of the network.

        Here,
        B = Batch size
        T = Acoustic model timesteps
        U = Target sequence length
        H1, H2 = Hidden dimensions of the Encoder / Decoder respectively
        H = Hidden dimension of the Joint hidden step.
        V = Vocabulary size of the Decoder (excluding the RNNT blank token).

        NOTE:
            The implementation of this model is slightly modified from the original paper.
            The original paper proposes the following steps :
            (enc, dec) -> Expand + Concat + Sum [B, T, U, H1+H2] -> Forward through joint hidden [B, T, U, H] -- *1
            *1 -> Forward through joint final [B, T, U, V + 1].

            We instead split the joint hidden into joint_hidden_enc and joint_hidden_dec and act as follows:
            enc -> Forward through joint_hidden_enc -> Expand [B, T, 1, H] -- *1
            dec -> Forward through joint_hidden_dec -> Expand [B, 1, U, H] -- *2
            (*1, *2) -> Sum [B, T, U, H] -> Forward through joint final [B, T, U, V + 1].
