class GlobalAverageLossMetric(Metric):
    """
    This class is for averaging loss across multiple processes if a distributed backend is used. True average is
    computed not running average. It does not accumulate gradients so the averaged loss cannot be used for optimization.
    If ``take_avg_loss`` is ``True``, the :meth:`update` method ``loss`` argument has to be a mean loss. If
    ``take_avg_loss`` is ``False`` then the :meth:`update` method ``loss`` argument has to be a sum of losses.

    See :doc:`PyTorch Lightning Metrics<pytorch-lightning:metrics>` for the metric usage instruction.

    Args:
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and returns ``None`` if this is set to ``False``. default: ``True``
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step.
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called. default: ``None`` (which selects the entire
                world)
        take_avg_loss:
            If ``True`` values of :meth:`update` method ``loss`` argument has to be a mean loss. If ``False``
            values of :meth:`update` method ``loss`` argument has to be a sum of losses. default: ``True``
