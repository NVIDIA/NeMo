These scripts are used for extracting features from LJSpeech.

You will need to run the following scripts (note that these will call the other
scripts as necessary):

- `create_manifests_and_textfiles.py`: Creates the manifest and text files that
  are used by the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) library.
- `extract_ljspeech_phonemes_and_durs.sh`: Extracts phonemes and alignments via
  MFA and calculates phoneme durations.
  Needs to be run with Conda active since it creates a Conda environment.
  Also note that you may need to install OpenBlas manually (e.g. sudo apt-get
  install libopenblas-dev), sometimes MFA can't find it if installed via Conda.
  (This script calls `create_token2idx_dict.py` and `calculate_durs.py`.)
- `extract_ljspeech_energy_pitch.py`
