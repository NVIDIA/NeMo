###### RNNT WER calculation when fused batch size > 1 during validation / test step()

Previously, the RNNT metric was stateful while the CTC one was not ([r1.22.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/r1.22.0/nemo/collections/asr/metrics/rnnt_wer_bpe.py#L419-L420), [r1.23.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/r1.23.0/nemo/collections/asr/metrics/wer.py#L333))

Therefore this calculation in the RNNT joint for fused operation worked properly. However with the unification of metrics in r1.23.0, a bug was introduced where only the last sub-batch of metrics calculates the scores and does not accumulate. This is patched via https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/pull/8587 and will be fixed in the next release.

**Workaround**: Explicitly disable fused batch size during inference using the following command

```python
from omegaconf import open_dict
model = ...
decoding_cfg = model.cfg.decoding
with open_dict(decoding_cfg):
  decoding_cfg.fused_batch_size = -1
model.change_decoding_strategy(decoding_cfg)
```

Note: This bug does not affect scores calculated via model.transcribe() (since it does not calculate metrics during inference, just text), or using the `transcribe_speech.py` or `speech_to_text_eval.py` in `examples/asr`.

###### Two failing unit tests due to a change in expected results, caused by lhotse version update
